I have experience in full stack, backend development, data analysis and technical troubleshooting totaling to over 3 years of experience in the IT programming sector. I also have a diploma in Computer Engineering Technology and a degree in the Bachelor of Applied Information Systems Technology program both of which were from the Northern Alberta Institute of Technology (NAIT). I am currently persuing a Cisco CCNA certificate and would like to persue a career in Cybersecurity having networking as a launching point for a career in that space.Having said that, I also have profound interest in technology and a dedication to solving complex problems.

## Objective

My journey in computer science and IT has led me to develop a passion for both computer science and cybersecurity, and I am now eager to transition into this field, specifically aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst.
